[Tip1]
Compiling and running steps of java programs in command line:
$ javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java
$ java MyFirstJavaProgram 

In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other.

When we consider a Java program it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods.
注：调用另一个对象的方法，就是所谓的向另一个对象发送消息。

主函数类与被调用放在同一路径下，编译时，只编译主函数类即可。
